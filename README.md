## Overview

EcoSENS is a platform that gives farmers the ability to upload data to analyze pest risk and heat stress and to share that data to other farmers in the same area

### Key Features

-  **Data uploading** - Farmers can upload data, images of their sticky pest trap, and details from their microclimate sensors, which will go through an algorithm forecasting trends and what they need to do.
-  **Community forecasting** - Farmers can see the calculated data of all of the submitted data in their area.  Farmers can use this to determine if pest risk and heat stress trends are specific to them only or for their entire area.
-  **Social feed** - Farmers can post their current forecast to share what they're experiencing to other farmers
